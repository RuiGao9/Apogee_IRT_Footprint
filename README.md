## Brief introduction of this repository
This repository is designed to generate footprint estimates for Apogee IRT sensors with circular fields of view. Upon completion, the program outputs the results in both GeoTIFF and Shapefile formats.
- "Apogee_IRT_Footprint.pdf," a detailed explanation can be found in this document.
- "main.ipynb" is the script where you can modify parameters based on your needs.
